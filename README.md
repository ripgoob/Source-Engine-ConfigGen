Source Engine ConfigGen is a command-line tool that automatically detects and generates the best performance configuration for older Source engine games.

It takes the user’s hardware into account, generates a tailored config file, and replaces or patches the game’s existing config for optimized performance.

NOTE: i am not the best programmer and this is my first big project so bear with me...
